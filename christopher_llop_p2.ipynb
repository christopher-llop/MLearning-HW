    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "a) The nearest neighbors does not work well because we have a very sparse vector space with many features (words) that differ between training examples. As such, the nearest neighbor might be quite a ways off! Because of this distance, it makes sense that our classifer makes a lot of mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The NB model assumes independance between features. That is, for each potential classification, we calculate the likelihood of that classification given each indpendant feature we see. There is no linearity requirement. However, Logistic Regression attempts to draw a line to separate the data points. Since the feature space of words is large and complicated, it makes sense that NB preforms better.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) L2 regularization penalizes large coefficients, because large coefficients are more likely to occur when we are overfitting. As we see above, low value of C (stronger regularization) leads to lower model coefficients beacuse of higher regularization penalites. In this case, we see that models with higher penalities wind up with lower coefficients, expressed as the sum of squared coefficients."

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

This might help us differentiate between technical terms used in technical context, from technical terms being used in the same post as terms such as \"Book [stop word] Mormon\". I imagine it is quite easy for the alg to mix up \"religion\" and \"atheism\" as the two discussion topics have some common elements. We also might want to create an ensemble method that simply tries to pick between \"atheism\" and \"religon\". When the probabilities of the current method are close, we could look to this second model for more information."
